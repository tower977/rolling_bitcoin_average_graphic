# rolling_bitcoin_average_graphic


This script takes the data on bitcoin and plots it by date, applying a rolling average.

There is scope for terminal arguments and the plot itself is interactive that can be shared easily among others in HTML format.

There will be a follow up selenium script to retrieve the data in the future and feed the retrieved file through the terminal into the script in this repository
